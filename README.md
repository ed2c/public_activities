The second CEDA Workhsop
- [General introduction and 1 Cijfer PowerBI dashboard](https://github.com/ed2c/public_activities/blob/main/20240624_Intro_CEDA_Workshop_1_Cijfer_PowerBI.pdf) ([repo](https://github.com/ed2c/1cho_ins_visualisation_powerbi/tree/main))
- [Wisselstroom / student routes](https://github.com/ed2c/public_activities/blob/main/20240624_Wisselstroom.pdf) ([repo](https://github.com/ed2c/wisselstroom_demo))

We moved to a larger external location, that was still rather crowded (with people crawling under the tables)
